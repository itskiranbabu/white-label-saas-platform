## Pricing Strategies

### Value-Based Pricing

**Principle:** Price based on value delivered, not cost

**How to implement:**
1. Identify customer segments
2. Quantify value for each segment
3. Price at 10-20% of value delivered
4. Test and iterate

**Example:**
```
If your platform saves customers $10,000/month in costs:
→ Price at $1,000-2,000/month (10-20% of value)
```

---

### Competitive Pricing

**Principle:** Price relative to competitors

**Strategies:**
- **Premium:** 20-30% above competitors (justify with superior features)
- **Parity:** Match competitor pricing (compete on features/service)
- **Penetration:** 20-30% below competitors (gain market share)

**Research competitors:**
```
Competitor A: $99/month
Competitor B: $149/month
Competitor C: $79/month

Your pricing options:
Premium:     $179/month (best features)
Parity:      $99/month (match market)
Penetration: $59/month (gain share)
```

---

### Psychological Pricing

**Tactics:**
- **Charm Pricing:** $29 instead of $30 (feels cheaper)
- **Prestige Pricing:** $1,000 instead of $999 (premium positioning)
- **Anchoring:** Show expensive plan first (makes others seem reasonable)
- **Decoy Pricing:** Middle tier designed to make premium attractive

**Example:**
```
Basic:    $29/month  (anchor - makes Pro seem reasonable)
Pro:      $99/month  (target - most popular)
Premium:  $299/month (decoy - makes Pro attractive)
```
